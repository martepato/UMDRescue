# UMDRescue
UMDRescue is a UMD disc dumper allowing you to backup your UMD discs for personal use using a PSP. The kxploit version will create a 1:1 backup unlike the higher Firmware version. This is due to permissions it seems that Sony
decided to bump security up on runlevel permissions later on in higher Firmwares. The None kxploit version will still dump Games fine. Just nothing else on the UMD.
